title: "UI/UX Design"
---
In the midst of the digital revolution, the demand for products that are functional and intuitive is on rise. Digitalization impacts all areas of life and affects people of all ages — no one should feel left behind.

Good UI/UX design makes a product easier to use, more valuable and more enjoyable to interact with. Aesthetics and functionality, aligned to create the best possible user experience, so people don’t regret the arrival of technology in their lives.

Currently, there is one project in my portfolio:

- [Dental clinic landing page.](design/dental-clinic-landing.qmd){.main-link} Desktop and mobile design for a website of a fictional dental clinic.
