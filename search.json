    "text": "Cholesterol types\nCholesterol does not travel alone in blood due to its low solubility (it cannot mix with water, as it happens with oil). For this purpose, it is transported inside structures called lipoproteins, which are made of both water-friendly and fat-friendly components. The type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol determines its classification in:\n\nHDL-cholesterol: High-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. It helps to remove excess cholesterol from blood vessels and therefore it is known as the “good” cholesterol.\nLDL-cholesterol: Low-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol from the liver to other parts of the body. If there is excess cholesterol, it accumulates in blood as cells will only take up the cholesterol they need. Its accumulation in our arteries is dangerous because it contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore it is known as the “bad” cholesterol.",

    "text": "How does high LDL-cholesterol contribute to cardiovascular disease?\nUnder normal conditions, LDL cholesterol cannot easily pass through the inner lining of our blood vessels, the endothelium. However, chronically elevated LDL levels, in the presence of a higher endothelial permeability — due to factors like high blood pressure, inflammation or genetics — can lead to the entry of these LDL particles in the subendothelial space, where they accumulate forming a fatty plaque. This process is known as atherosclerosis.\nThese plaques grow slowly over many years, often without causing noticeable symptoms. As they grow, they narrow the blood flow, so the amount of oxygen and nutrients the reach the surrounding tissues is reduced. Depending on the affected vessel type, symptoms may vary, including angina, dizziness or muscle pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Healthy artery: HDL in blue, LDL in yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf left untreated, the constant blood flow through the narrowed artery puts pressure on the inflamed area, which increases the risk of the plaque rupturing. Plaque rupture worsens the condition. The body reacts to the damage by forming a blood clot on the affected area, which can further narrow the artery or block it completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Blocked artery by plaque rupture and blood clot.\n\n\n\n\nIf this happens in a coronary artery, it can cause a heart attack. If it occurs in a carotid artery, it may lead to a stroke. Both are serious, potentially life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical attention.",

    "text": "Introduction\nDiabetes is a chronic endocrine disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to inadequate insulin action. According to the 2025 International Diabetes Federation Atlas1, 11.1% of the global adult population is living with diabetes and 40% of them are unaware of it. Considering the serious health risks associated with it, especially when left untreated, a close examination of its causes and increasing prevalence is warranted.\nThe major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an autoimmune process consisting on the self-destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells, which leads to an absolute insulin deficiency. It is impacted by genetic and environmental factors but its exact causes and prevention strategies remain unknown2. It accounts for 5-10% of diabetes cases3.\nConversely, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is related to two main pathophysiological mechanisms: a decrease in the sensitivity of the target tissues to insulin, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance, and a progressive dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells, which leads to insufficient insulin secretion. While genetic predisposition plays a role, the development of type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to obesity and physical inactivity. It is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for more than 90% of all cases4. Given its high prevalence and the proven effectiveness of prevention strategies in delaying or even preventing disease onset, type 2 diabetes is the focus of this study.",

It is ranked among the top 10 causes of disease-related deaths worldwide. Although the incidence of diabetes is increasing in both sexes, it is estimated that worldwide 17.7 million more men than women suffer from the disease6. This growing burden is largely driven by rising global rates of obesity, which has more than doubled since 19907.",

    "section": "Pathophysiology",
    "text": "Pathophysiology\nInsulin is a peptide hormone which regulates blood glucose levels by promoting its uptake and storage, especially in skeletal muscle, liver and white adipose tissue. It is produced by β cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, both basally to maintain glucose homeostasis and in larger pulsatile bursts after meals. Physiologically, it binds to plasma membrane-bound receptors in target cells, activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which facilitates glucose uptake, inhibits gluconeogenesis and enhances glycogen synthesis8.\nThe metabolites of chronic overnutrition, such as high glucose and non-esterified fatty acids, interfere with the activation of the insulin receptor and its subsequent metabolic signalling cascade, leading to a progressive insulin resistance. The pancreas responds by increasing insulin secretion, so that blood glucose stability can be maintained8. Eventually, if this condition persists, β cells are no longer able to secrete enough insulin to compensate for the abnormally high blood glucose, resulting in the progression to diabetes. It culminates in β-cell failure, likely due to glucose and lipid toxicity9.",

    "section": "Diagnostic criteria",
    "text": "Diagnostic criteria\nDiabetes can be diagnosed by different biomarkers.\n\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG): A blood sample is taken after an 8-hour overnight fast. If plasma glucose is ≥126mg/dl, the patient is considered diabetic10.\nGlycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C): It measures the amount of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose. Since glycation occurs gradually over the lifespan of an erythrocyte (approximately 120 days), HbA1C is considered an indicator of average plasma glucose over the past 8 to 12 weeks. It does not require fasting and is not affected by acute stress11. A value of HbA1c ≥6.5% indicates diabetes10.\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Plasma glucose is measured before and 2 hours after the ingestion of 75g of glucose. If the 2-hour plasma glucose is ≥200 mg/dl, the patient is considered diabetic10.\nCasual plasma glucose test: It is performed when the patient manifests classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. If plasma glucose is ≥200mg/dl, diabetes can be diagnosed10.\n\nIn all cases, it is recommended to repeat the test on a different day to confirm the diagnosis.\nAs different types of diabetes have distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, it is essential to identify which type of diabetes a patient has. Clinicians predominantly rely on clinical features to differentiate type 1 diabetes (T1D) from type 2 diabetes (T2D)12. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the AABBCC approach, which involves considering the following factors: Age; Autoimmunity (e.g., personal or family history of autoimmune disease); Body habitus (e.g., body mass index); Background (e.g., family history of diabetes); Control (e.g., the inability to achieve glycemic goals on noninsulin therapies); and Comorbidities13. Late disease onset during adulthood and obesity are indicative of T2D, while T1D is typically associated with younger individuals (&lt;35 years), lower BMI (&lt;25 kg/m2) and ketoacidosis. However, this approach carries a risk of misclassification. In Spain, over the last decade, approximately 40% of patients with T1D onset after the age of 30 years were initially diagnosed as T2D. Therefore, the assessment of pancreatic autoimmunity is recommended in all patients with a suspected diagnosis of T1D to prevent misdiagnosis13.",

    "text": "Treatment\nThere is currently no cure for any type of diabetes. However, several treatment options are available for T2D, enabling patients to keep the disease under control and avoid serious complications. The cornerstone of effective management is lifestyle intervention: balanced nutrition while minimizing added sugars, refined grains and highly processed foods; regular physical activity; weight loss; abstinence from tobacco; and good quality sleep14.\nDepending on the severity of hyperglycemia at diagnosis and other clinical factors, such as the presence of symptoms or comorbidities, medication may be initiated immediately alongside lifestyle interventions to achieve better glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications. Common non-insulin medications include metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, as well as more recently introduced agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors.15.\nDue to the progressive nature of T2D, many patients will eventually require insulin therapy. GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered as the first injectable agents before basal insulin, given the strong evidence supporting their efficacy. If additional treatment is needed, basal insulin should be introduced first and titrated to a maximum effective dose in a safe and timely way14. Approximately one-third of patients with T2D require treatment with insulin during their lifetime16.\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended for patients who take insulin or other medications that carry a risk of hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas. There is no clear consensus regarding its benefit in individuals with stable glycemic control managed through lifestyle or non-hypoglycemic agents17. Continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGM), which are worn passively and measure interstitial glucose values every 1–5 min, are increasingly being adopted by T2D patients who are treated with insulin.",
