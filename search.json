    "text": "Introduction\nDiabetes is a chronic endocrine disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to inadequate insulin action. According to the 2025 International Diabetes Federation Atlas1, 11.1% of the global adult population is living with diabetes and 40% of them are unaware of it. Considering the serious health risks associated with it, especially when left untreated, a close examination of its causes and increasing prevalence is warranted.\nThe major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an autoimmune process consisting on the self-destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells, which leads to an absolute insulin deficiency. It is impacted by genetic and environmental factors but its exact causes and prevention strategies remain unknown2. It accounts for 5-10% of diabetes cases3.\nConversely, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is related to two main pathophysiological mechanisms: a decrease in the sensitivity of the target tissues to insulin, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance, and a progressive dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells, which leads to insufficient insulin secretion. While genetic predisposition plays a role, the development of type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to obesity and physical inactivity. It is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for more than 90% of all cases4. Given its high prevalence and the proven effectiveness of prevention strategies in delaying or even preventing disease onset, type 2 diabetes is the focus of this study.",

It is ranked among the top 10 causes of disease-related deaths worldwide. Although the incidence of diabetes is increasing in both sexes, it is estimated that worldwide 17.7 million more men than women suffer from the disease6. This growing burden is largely driven by rising global rates of obesity, which has more than doubled since 19907.",

    "text": "Pathophysiology\nInsulin is a peptide hormone which regulates blood glucose levels by promoting its uptake and storage, especially in skeletal muscle, liver and white adipose tissue. It is produced by β cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, both basally to maintain glucose homeostasis and in larger pulsatile bursts after meals. Physiologically, it binds to plasma membrane-bound receptors in target cells, activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which facilitates glucose uptake, inhibits gluconeogenesis and enhances glycogen synthesis8.\nThe metabolites of chronic overnutrition, such as high glucose and non-esterified fatty acids, interfere with the activation of the insulin receptor and its subsequent metabolic signalling cascade, leading to a progressive insulin resistance. The pancreas responds by increasing insulin secretion, so that blood glucose stability can be maintained8. Eventually, if this condition persists, β cells are no longer able to secrete enough insulin to compensate for the abnormally high blood glucose, resulting in the progression to diabetes. It culminates in β-cell failure, likely due to glucose and lipid toxicity9.",

    "text": "Diagnostic criteria\nDiabetes can be diagnosed by different biomarkers.\n\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG): A blood sample is taken after an 8-hour overnight fast. If plasma glucose is ≥126mg/dl, the patient is considered diabetic10.\nGlycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C): It measures the amount of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose. Since glycation occurs gradually over the lifespan of an erythrocyte (approximately 120 days), HbA1C is considered an indicator of average plasma glucose over the past 8 to 12 weeks. It does not require fasting and is not affected by acute stress11. A value of HbA1c ≥6.5% indicates diabetes10.\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Plasma glucose is measured before and 2 hours after the ingestion of 75g of glucose. If the 2-hour plasma glucose is ≥200 mg/dl, the patient is considered diabetic10.\nCasual plasma glucose test: It is performed when the patient manifests classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. If plasma glucose is ≥200mg/dl, diabetes can be diagnosed10.\n\nIn all cases, it is recommended to repeat the test on a different day to confirm the diagnosis.\nAs different types of diabetes have distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, it is essential to identify which type of diabetes a patient has. Clinicians predominantly rely on clinical features to differentiate type 1 diabetes (T1D) from type 2 diabetes (T2D)12. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the AABBCC approach, which involves considering the following factors: Age; Autoimmunity (e.g., personal or family history of autoimmune disease); Body habitus (e.g., body mass index); Background (e.g., family history of diabetes); Control (e.g., the inability to achieve glycemic goals on noninsulin therapies); and Comorbidities13. Late disease onset during adulthood and obesity are indicative of T2D, while T1D is typically associated with younger individuals (&lt;35 years), lower BMI (&lt;25 kg/m2) and ketoacidosis. However, this approach carries a risk of misclassification. In Spain, over the last decade, approximately 40% of patients with T1D onset after the age of 30 years were initially diagnosed as T2D. Therefore, the assessment of pancreatic autoimmunity is recommended in all patients with a suspected diagnosis of T1D to prevent misdiagnosis13.",

    "text": "Treatment\nThere is currently no cure for any type of diabetes. However, several treatment options are available for T2D, enabling patients to keep the disease under control and avoid serious complications. The cornerstone of effective management is lifestyle intervention: balanced nutrition while minimizing added sugars, refined grains and highly processed foods; regular physical activity; weight loss; abstinence from tobacco; and good quality sleep14.\nDepending on the severity of hyperglycemia at diagnosis and other clinical factors, such as the presence of symptoms or comorbidities, medication may be initiated immediately alongside lifestyle interventions to achieve better glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications. Common non-insulin medications include metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, as well as more recently introduced agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors.15.\nDue to the progressive nature of T2D, many patients will eventually require insulin therapy. GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered as the first injectable agents before basal insulin, given the strong evidence supporting their efficacy. If additional treatment is needed, basal insulin should be introduced first and titrated to a maximum effective dose in a safe and timely way14. Approximately one-third of patients with T2D require treatment with insulin during their lifetime16.\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended for patients who take insulin or other medications that carry a risk of hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas. There is no clear consensus regarding its benefit in individuals with stable glycemic control managed through lifestyle or non-hypoglycemic agents17. Continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGM), which are worn passively and measure interstitial glucose values every 1–5 min, are increasingly being adopted by T2D patients who are treated with insulin.",

This combination makes bones hard to deform but not fragile. Regarding its cells2:\n\nOsteoblasts promote bone formation by the synthesis of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix.\nOsteocytes derive from osteoblasts. In particular, osteoblasts differentiate to osteocytes when they get trapped in the newly synthesized bone matrix. They are responsible for the mechanotransduction of bone (its response to mechanical signals).\nOsteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, resulting in the breaking down of the tissue and the release of calcium and phosphate to the bloodstream. This process is essential in a healthy bone: it allows for the removal of old and damaged bone and its adaptation to new mechanical loads (bones can change shape depending on how they are used).",

    "text": "Bone remodeling regulation\nThe recruitment of osteoclasts is regulated primarily by osteoblasts. Osteoblasts express RANK ligand (RANKL) on their membrane surfaces, which interacts with RANK, a receptor on osteoclasts membranes. This binding triggers the differentiation of preosteoclasts into active osteoclasts. However, osteoblasts also produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), which competes with RANK for the binding to RANKL, decreasing the activation of osteoclasts. Therefore, the RANKL/OPG ratio is an indicator of the physiological balance of bone remodeling. A high ratio (RANKL&gt;OPG) favors resorption (for example, at the beginning of the cycle), and a low ratio (OPG&gt;RANK) corresponds to inhibited resorption and a bone formation phase3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Remodeling process and RANK-RANKL interaction.

Estrogen decline during menopause is tightly associated to bone loss and the development of osteoporosis5.\nParathyroid hormone (PTH): secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia, stimulating bone resorption and the release of calcium into the bloodstream1.\nCalcitonin: synthesized by the C cells of the thyroid in response to hypercalcemia. It inhibits bone resorption by reducing the number and activity of osteoclasts1.\nCalcitriol (active form of vitamin D): vitamin D, obtained through sun exposure or diet (eggs, fatty fish…) is transformed into calcitriol, a hormone that promotes calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines, crucial for bone mineralization.

The following two images would ideally show portraits of the clinic’s doctors to help build trust."

The “Contact” button features bold text, is accompanied by a mouse pointer icon, and is positioned at the top right to draw attention and encourage user interaction.\nThe hero section displays a happy and healthy family, reflecting the clinic’s core patients and values. Its message, summarized in three lines, reinforces the promotion of dental health and the offering for help.\nIn a clinical environment, it is crucial for visitors to know who is in charge and why they can be trusted. The team section addresses this by showcasing the doctors’ qualifications, personal photos, and professional experience. Trust is further reinforced by a dedicated reviews section, featuring patient testimonials and highlighting the clinic’s key strengths.\nFinally, the contact information is placed at the bottom of the page, following a common and intuitive structure. Since the website is short and this setion is inmmediatley displayed when pressing the contact button at the top, this placement should not hinder accessibility.\n\n\nMobile responsiveness\nFor the mobile version, content is stacked vertically and the buttons texts are simplified, ensuring a good experience."

    "section": "Hemoglobin and its critical role",
    "text": "Hemoglobin and its critical role\nHemoglobin is a spherical protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen inside the body. It is composed by 4 peptidic chains, each one associated with a heme prosthetic group, a central ferrous atom (Fe²⁺) in a porphyrin ring, which is able to link reversible to an oxygen molecule. Therefore, each hemoglobin protein can carry 4 oxygen molecules4.\nFor this protein to be an effective oxygen carrier, it must bind oxygen in the lungs, where the partial pressure is about 100 mmHg, and release it in the tissues, where it drops to around 20–40 mmHg. Therefore, its affinity for oxygen, that is, its tendency to bind to it, should vary depending on the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding environment. In the figure below, the fraction of hemoglobin saturation (oxyhemoglobin) is shown as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen. The relationship is not linear but sigmoidal, which perfectly matches the physiological needs of the body: lower affinity — indicated by a shallower slope — in low-oxygen environments (tissues), and higher affinity in high-oxygen environments (lungs)4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve. Original graph created following Hill equation, considering p50 = 26mmHg and n = 2’7.\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon stems from the positive cooperativity among the four subunits of hemoglobin: the binding of one subunit to oxygen increases the affinity of the remaining subunits due to a conformational change in the protein4.",

    "text": "CO and its damage potential\nCO has 200 to 250 times greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, making this interaction highly favorable. As a result, even low concentrations of CO can displace oxygen from hemoglobin5.\nThe damage caused by CO is not limited to its high affinity for hemoglobin. While a 50% reduction in hemoglobin due to anemia is not immediately life-threatening, a 50% concentration of COHb (hemoglobin bound to CO) is fatal. This is because CO binding to one subunit of hemoglobin activates the positive cooperativity of the remaining subunits towards oxygen, increasing their affinity. As a result, the hemoglobin molecule cannot efficiently release oxygen to tissues. Some oxygen gets trapped in COHb molecules, while the unaffected hemoglobin molecules are exposed to lower oxygen concentrations, leading to severe tissue hypoxia5. If untreated, tissue hypoxia can result in death. Treatment consists of immediate removal from the carbon monoxide source and supplemental oxygen administration.",

It provides a clear clinical example of fundamental biochemical principles. Since CO poisoning is one of the most common types of poisoning worldwide, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to understand its mechanism of action and to raise public awareness for its prevention. For a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions responsible for hemoglobin’s cooperativity, readers are encouraged to consult the biochemistry textbooks listed in the references section.",

In the beginning, it seems you are able to deal with everything and keep your productivity up. The day stretches and sleep moves to second place, until sleep deprivation becomes the main character. You can’t focus, irritation is your mood and productivity sinks. You are just tired, very tired, and even after a full night’s sleep, the recovery is not complete. There was actually no net gain: everything you thought you were gaining is now slipping away, and more importantly, there is a price to pay: your health.\nThe symptoms you are undergoing are only the tip of the iceberg: your brain is under stress, your immune system has weakened and you are more likely to suffer a heart attack. You decide to change your habits, so that the foggy mind is gone and your high productivity is back. For some weeks, it works. Through an active effort you manage to follow the plan and get the rest you need. Eventually, urgent responsibilities kick in: the project deadline, the exams, the kids… The cycle starts again. I will manage, you think, despite the exhaustion and the chaos.\nYour body is keeping score. Every sleep-deprived season leaves a scar. In the long term, the chickens come home to roost.

The type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol determines its classification in:\n\nHDL-cholesterol: High-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. It helps to remove excess cholesterol from blood vessels and therefore it is known as the “good” cholesterol.\nLDL-cholesterol: Low-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol from the liver to other parts of the body. If there is excess cholesterol, it accumulates in blood as cells will only take up the cholesterol they need. Its accumulation in our arteries is dangerous because it contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore it is known as the “bad” cholesterol.",

    "text": "How does high LDL-cholesterol contribute to cardiovascular disease?\nUnder normal conditions, LDL cholesterol cannot easily pass through the inner lining of our blood vessels, the endothelium. However, chronically elevated LDL levels, in the presence of a higher endothelial permeability — due to factors like high blood pressure, inflammation or genetics — can lead to the entry of these LDL particles in the subendothelial space, where they accumulate forming a fatty plaque. This process is known as atherosclerosis.\nThese plaques grow slowly over many years, often without causing noticeable symptoms. As they grow, they narrow the blood flow, so the amount of oxygen and nutrients the reach the surrounding tissues is reduced. Depending on the affected vessel type, symptoms may vary, including angina, dizziness or muscle pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Healthy artery: HDL in blue, LDL in yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\n\nIf left untreated, the constant blood flow through the narrowed artery puts pressure on the inflamed area, which increases the risk of the plaque rupturing. Plaque rupture worsens the condition. The body reacts to the damage by forming a blood clot on the affected area, which can further narrow the artery or block it completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Blocked artery by plaque rupture and blood clot.\n\n\n\n\nIf this happens in a coronary artery, it can cause a heart attack. If it occurs in a carotid artery, it may lead to a stroke. Both are serious, potentially life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical attention.",
