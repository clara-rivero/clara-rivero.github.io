Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a medical student and biomedical engineer, passionate about healthcare, communication and design. I specialize in creating medical content — from scientific articles to patient-oriented materials — and visuals, alongside UI/UX design and frontend development. My technical background is supported by several years of experience in devops engineering.

I offer freelance services in my areas of expertise: medical writing, visual communication and digital product design. I speak fluent English, native Spanish and intermediate German (B2).
