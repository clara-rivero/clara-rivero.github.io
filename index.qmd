Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a medical student and biomedical engineer, passionate about healthcare, communication and design. I specialize in creating medical content — from scientific articles to patient-oriented materials — and visuals, alongside UI/UX design. My technical background, supported by several years of experience in IT, allows me to approach digital projects with a well-rounded perspective. 

I offer freelance services in medical writing, visual content creation and digital product design. I speak fluent English, native Spanish and intermediate German (B2).
