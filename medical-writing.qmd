title: "Medical writing"
---

Health matters to all of us. In a fast-changing, technology-driven world where a vast amount of information is at our fingertips, there is a growing need for clarity, structure and accuracy.

Medical writing is an extensive field, which may include, among others:

- Up-to-date technical information for healthcare professionals or students.
- Health communication for the general public, where explaining complex topics in a simple but rigorous manner is required.
- Content creation for health startups and companies.

In this portfolio, I include four articles with different styles:

- [Type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive literature review.](medical-writing/diabetes-review.qmd) Addressed to healthcare professionals and students.
-  [Cholesterol practical guide.](medical-writing/cholesterol-guide.qmd)  Addressed to the general public.
- [Eye care essentials.](medical-writing/cholesterol-guide.qmd) An infographic which may be delivered by an eye health company or organization.
- [Stop making excuses: prioritize your sleep.](medical-writing/rest-copywriting.qmd) A copywriting article which aims to encourage good sleeping habits.
